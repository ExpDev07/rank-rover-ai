## üí¨ Message from author

This is the first AI SaaS that I built. It is fully functional and with features. I decided to open source it as the market intended for the 
product is tought and I did not manage to get much traction. It's now here for everyone to copy from, whether you want to continue building it 
or need inspiration / starter kit.
